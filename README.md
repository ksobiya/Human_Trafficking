## Motivation:
As a project inspired by the growing concern over human trafficking globally, this analysis aims to delve into the factors contributing to human trafficking, identify high-risk countries for both inflow and outflow of victims, and shed light on the most common causes and forms of human trafficking. The motivation stems from a desire to raise awareness and contribute to efforts aimed at combating this heinous crime.

## Questions:
Which countries are at high risk for human trafficking in terms of both inflow and outflow of victims?
What are the primary factors contributing to human trafficking?
What are the most common forms of human trafficking, and what are victims trafficked for the most?
Which gender and age groups are most vulnerable to human trafficking?
## Data Sources:
 * The analysis utilizes data primarily sourced from the CTDC Global dataset, which provides comprehensive information on human trafficking incidents worldwide. Additionally, latitude and longitude data for geospatial analysis were sourced from GitHub repositories specializing in geographical datasets.

 * Latitude and Longitude Data (GitHub)
Challenges Faced:
One of the major challenges encountered during the project was the nature of the dataset, which consisted mainly of binary values (0s and 1s). Cleaning and preprocessing the data to extract meaningful insights required meticulous filtering and transformation processes. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the geospatial data added complexity to the analysis.

## Technologies Used:
Python : Data cleaning and preprocessing
Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation
GitHub: Version control and collaboration

## Conclusion:
The analysis reveals insights into the prevalence and dynamics of human trafficking globally. High-risk countries for both inflow and outflow of victims have been identified, along with the primary factors driving human trafficking. Common forms of human trafficking and the demographics of victims have also been explored. By shedding light on these critical aspects, this analysis contributes to the collective efforts aimed at combating human trafficking and protecting vulnerable populations worldwide.
